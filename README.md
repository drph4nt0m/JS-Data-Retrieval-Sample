# POSCON JavaScript Automated ATIS Retrieval

Welcome! If you're reading this page, you probably want to program your own ATIS retrieval software. This can be used to either pull an ATIS from a live source, or generate one automatically.

__TOC__

## Architecture

All user-supplied JavaScript for the purpose of retriving an ATIS is run in a v8 Isolate. What does that mean? It means your code is running in an isolated process, with no access to the host machine. We use this to ensure that no other ATIS retrieval code supplied by other users can impact the performance of your scripts.

There may be _one_ file provided per FIR, which must contain all code for ATIS retrieval for any airports within the FIR. Unsafe functions, modules, and objects are also disabled, such as `process`, `eval`, and `fs`.

### Recommended Development Environment

Our servers use Node v14 on an Alpine image, and store scripts on a remote location.

### Entrypoint

When your script is called, the host machine looks for the default export, which must be an entrypoint in the following form:

```javascript
functionName(icao)

module.exports = functionName
```

The host will run the default export. It can return a `Promise`, but may not require or return a callback. It can also be an asynchronous function - it must simply accept a single argument (an ICAO-formatted airport identifier), and return either a `Promise` that resolves to data, or returns JSON data directly.

### Response Format

The desired response is either a `Promise` that resolves to this, or this directly:

```json
{
    "arrival": "<arrival ATIS, if present>",
    "departure": "<departure ATIS, if present>",
    "body": "<ATIS, if departure/arrival are not separated>"
}
```

**You may _only_ return _either_ body, or _both_ arrival and departure**

## Allowed Modules

The following modules are currently allowed to be `require`'d by a script:

- [jsdom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom)
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)

If you would like a library added that is not currently available, please email [support@poscon.net](mailto:support@poscon.net) with the library name and justification for its inclusion.

## Sample Code

The following code will retrieve the ATIS for Hong Kong International Airport (VHHH)

```javascript
const JSDOM = require("jsdom").JSDOM;
const axios = require("axios")

const vhhh_url = "http://atis.cad.gov.hk/ATIS/ATISweb/atis.php"


function cleanHTML(html) {

    let ret = html.replace(/\n/g, " ")
    ret = ret.replace(/\t/g, "")
    ret = ret.replace(/[ ]+/g, " ")
    ret = ret.replace(" ARRIVAL ", "")
    ret = ret.replace(" DEPARTURE ", "")
    ret = ret.replace(/[\u00A0]/g, "")
    ret = ret.replace(/[ ]+/g, " ")
    ret = ret.substring(0, ret.length - 1)
    return ret
}

async function run(icao) {
    const response = await axios.get(vhhh_url);
    const dom = new JSDOM(response.data);
    const doc = dom.window.document
    const col1 = [...doc.querySelectorAll(".data_outer_1 .width_left")];
    const col2 = [...doc.querySelectorAll(".data_outer_3 .width_right")];

    const col1text = cleanHTML(col1[0].textContent)
    const col2text = cleanHTML(col2[0].textContent)
    const ret = {
        "arrival": col1text,
        "departure": col2text,
        "body": ""
    }

    return ret
}

module.exports = run
```

## I'm done, now what?

Once you've written your script, please send it to [support@poscon.net](mailto:support@poscon.net) to be integrated.
